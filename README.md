# Projektet-ne-Inteligjence-Artificiale
During our semester, as a team of three students, we delved into the fascinating realm of Artificial Intelligence, undertaking three noteworthy projects. Our first project involved an in-depth exploration of the applications of AI in Railway Transport, culminating in a seminar-style work. Additionally, we gained practical experience by implementing the Djikstra algorithm to tackle the Traveling Salesman Problem, and further expanded our skills by solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem using Simulated Annealing. These projects have equipped us with valuable knowledge and problem-solving abilities, which we are eager to showcase and develop further on our individual Github profiles.
